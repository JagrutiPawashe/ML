### Why ML?  
Machine learning (ML) has become a cornerstone of modern technology, revolutionizing industries and reshaping the way we interact with the world. As a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), ML enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Its importance spans various domains, from healthcare to finance, and from retail to transportation. In this article, we'll explore why ML is important, highlighting its transformative potential and the numerous benefits it offers.
